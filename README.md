# Pytorch tutorials
I've built a couple neural networks with tensorflow before, and have heard good things about pytorch but just never got around to trying it out.
Well now I am.
I'm going to find some decent introductory tutorials and use this repo as a place to aggregate them. 
If there are some blank sections below, that's because it's something I want to do but haven't yet.

The official pytorch tutorials are [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
NVIDIA has a pytorch docker container [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/rel_19-09.html).

## [Pytorch 101](./60min_blitz/)
This is the "60-minute blitz", based on the official pytorch quickstart intro found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).

## MNIST classification
The "hello world" of deep learning

## Reinforcement learning

## NLP

## Graph neural networks
